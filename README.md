- Follow the principles of Clean Architecture to achieve separation of concerns and maintainability.
- Implement LiveData and ViewModel to handle data observation and lifecycle management efficiently.
- Unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the application.
- Measure code coverage to assess the effectiveness of test cases.
- Utilize Coroutines for asynchronous programming and efficient handling of background tasks.
- Dependency injection using Dagger-Hilt for providing dependencies and improving testability.
- Network calls using Retrofit library for fetching news articles from a remote server.
- Utilize Jetpack Compose for building the user interface with a modern and declarative approach.
